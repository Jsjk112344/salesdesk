## Cards

All are 1920×1080 PNGs, rendered from HTML by Playwright at deviceScaleFactor 1:

- [Transparent title](cards/01-title.png) and [blurred Group composite](cards/01-title-composited.png).
- [Honest jump cut](cards/02-jumpcut.png), with the recorded run's measured time.
- [Before / after](cards/03-before-after.png).
- [Architecture](cards/04-architecture.png), plus `cards/04-architecture-build-1.png`
  through `cards/04-architecture-build-7.png` for the progressive diagram. The edit reveals the first six steps at one per second,
  then holds the full diagram for eight seconds.
- [End card](cards/05-end.png).

## Screen scenes

All are real app output from the public HTTPS URL, 1440×900, H.264, 30 fps:

| File | Length | Content |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| [scene1.mp4](scenes/scene1.mp4) | 14 s | Fresh saved Group view |
| [scene3.mp4](scenes/scene3.mp4) | 22 s | Real Run click, reset and six analysing tiles |
| [scene4.mp4](scenes/scene4.mp4) | 20 s | Finished Group; cursor follows narrated numbers |
| [scene5.mp4](scenes/scene5.mp4) | 8 s | Open Sandy |
| [scene6.mp4](scenes/scene6.mp4) | 38 s | Maria, timeline, match, trade, SMS and Email |
| [scene7.mp4](scenes/scene7.mp4) | 17 s | Approve Sandy, real Ready and download |
| [scene7-csv.mp4](scenes/scene7-csv.mp4) | 3 s | Byte-identical exported CSV, plain-text file viewer |
| [scene8.mp4](scenes/scene8.mp4) | 12 s | Enable schedule, close page, hold real final frame |

The final edit uses scene 7 for 14 seconds, the CSV preview at 2:06–2:09, then the
remaining three seconds of real Ready footage before Schedule at 2:12.
[crm-tasks.csv](scenes/crm-tasks.csv) is the actual approved 40-row synthetic export.

There are **33 crisp 2880×1800 stills** in `stills/`, one per choreography beat.
Their exact filenames and capture times are in `scene-manifest.json`.
