# Third-party materials

The initial source files were newly authored for SalesDesk; no application source was
copied from a private repository or a template generator. Planning references are linked
in the documentation; they are not bundled into the application.

Runtime dependencies and development tools are recorded in `uv.lock` and
`frontend/package-lock.json`. Their upstream licenses continue to apply independently
of this repository's MIT license. React, Vite, FastAPI and their tooling are dependencies,
not original SalesDesk work. Preserve their required notices when distributing bundles.

Before adding sample repositories, documents, images, model outputs or third-party code,
record the source, license/permission, author attribution and modifications here. Public
accessibility alone is not permission to redistribute. No external sample dataset is
included in the initialization baseline.

## Local execution slice — 2026-11-03

All controller/runner/validation code, probes, synthetic document and expected output
were authored for this public project. No private application image, code, customer
record or external sample dataset was reused. The deterministic fixture is not a model
output. No snippets were copied from the following implementation references.

- Task runtime: [Docker Official Python image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python), Python
  3.12 slim Bookworm, digest pinned in [infra/task-image.txt](infra/task-image.txt).
  Python carries the PSF license; the Debian base, GNU tar and other bundled programs
  retain their own licenses. The image is pulled, not vendored or relicensed as MIT.
  [Official image build sources](https://github.com/docker-library/python) and
  [Python license](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html).
- New dev-only dependency: [jsonschema](https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema)
  4.26.0 (MIT), for record schema tests. Transitive additions in `uv.lock`: attrs 26.1.0,
  jsonschema-specifications 2025.9.1, referencing 0.37.0 and rpds-py 2026.9.1 (all MIT,
  checked against installed package metadata). No new Python runtime dependency.
- Implementation references checked 2026-11-03: [Docker run constraints](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/run/),
  [Docker cp archive semantics](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/cp/),
  and [jsonschema validation API](https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/stable/validate/).
- Skill-required competition refresh on 2026-11-03: [official event](https://lablab.ai/ai-hackathons/vultr-hackathon)
  and [LabLab terms](https://lablab.ai/terms-of-use). No account activation, terms acceptance,
  credit redemption, provisioning, publication or submission was performed in this slice.

## Bounded inference workflow — 2026-11-03

The Vultr adapter, budget accounting, workflow, tests, additional synthetic documents,
answers and canned response parser are original SalesDesk code/data. No external sample
dataset or model output was imported. The offline parser is fixture source, not generated
code. No new runtime or development dependency was added; HTTP and process deadlines use
Python's standard library. No provider SDK, automatic retry layer or alternate provider.

Official technical API references checked for this implementation on 2026-11-03 (no
snippets copied): [Vultr chat-completions contract](https://api.vultrinference.com/docs/reference/create-chat-completion),
[request/context/output limits](https://api.vultrinference.com/docs/concepts/limits),
[quickstart and usage](https://api.vultrinference.com/docs/get-started/quickstart), and
[Vultr model/API FAQ](https://docs.vultr.com/products/compute/serverless-inference/faq).
No new competition/market research, account access, credit redemption or paid call was
performed; current model availability/prices must be verified before live authorization.

## First-live preflight — 2026-11-03

Official [Qwen 3.8 Flash Next model/pricing page](https://api.vultrinference.com/docs/models/qwen3.8-flash-next),
[public model metadata](https://api.vultrinference.com/v1/models/qwen3.8-flash-next),
[completion-token contract](https://api.vultrinference.com/docs/reference/create-chat-completion),
and [reasoning accounting](https://api.vultrinference.com/docs/concepts/reasoning)
were checked for the exact proposed request. Public catalog metadata is saved only in
ignored local preflight evidence; no example implementation was copied.

The catalog identifies [NVIDIA Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4)
as its model source. Public tokenizer data/configuration and chat template were downloaded
to ignored `.local/live-preflight/` for input-accounting inspection, not vendored or
relicensed. The upstream model card lists NVIDIA Open Model License and Qwen Community
License 1.0 terms. No weights were downloaded and no external template code was executed.
Hugging Face [Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) was used through
an ephemeral `uv run --with tokenizers` environment for the local token-count check;
it is not a SalesDesk runtime dependency and the dependency locks were unchanged.
The [official event](https://lablab.ai/ai-hackathons/vultr-hackathon) and
[LabLab terms](https://lablab.ai/terms-of-use) were refreshed as required by the skill.
No registration, terms acceptance, credit redemption, publication or submission occurred.

## Web journey and private Vultr preparation — 2026-11-05

All web queue, session scoping, worker integration, React UI, tests and deployment scripts
are original SalesDesk work. No private product code, console screenshot, customer record
or external sample document was imported. Both actual Vultr responses were rejected;
no provider-returned source was committed or presented as verified generated code.

- New dev-only HTTP testing dependency: [HTTPX](https://github.com/encode/httpx) 0.28.1
  (BSD-3-Clause), with HTTPcore 1.0.9 (BSD-3-Clause) and certifi 2026.10.23 (MPL-2.0),
  licenses checked from installed metadata. Dependency locks record these tools; no new
  application runtime dependency was added.
- Trusted UI checks use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker) 1.64.1 and the
  corresponding Microsoft container image, plus the exact `playwright@1.64.1` npm
  package inside a separate test image. Upstream Playwright is Apache-2.0; bundled browser/
  OS components retain their licenses. No browser binary or model weights are vendored.
  Tests use a mocked API and do not call models or browse external sites.
  Prettier 3.6.2 (MIT) was invoked as a pinned ephemeral formatting tool; it was not added
  to application dependencies or the deployment bundle.
- Official references refreshed: [Vultr reasoning/token accounting](https://api.vultrinference.com/docs/concepts/reasoning),
  [public model catalog](https://api.vultrinference.com/v1/models/qwen3.8-flash-next),
  [Docker Ubuntu installation context](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/),
  [Future of Work challenge](https://lablab.ai/ai-hackathons/vultr-hackathon), and
  [LabLab terms](https://lablab.ai/terms-of-use). No snippets copied. Server Docker was
  installed from the existing host's Ubuntu repositories; system package licenses remain
  upstream. The owner supplied the VM and SSH access; no new cloud resource was created.

## Sales agent reorientation — 2026-11-05 (second continuation)

All retrieval, evidence, contract, drafting, prospect-store, agent, worker, CLI, API,
React workspace, synthetic prospect pages, tests and browser-check code are original
SalesDesk work. The three synthetic prospect websites under `fixtures/prospects/` are
invented for this project; no real company, person or page was copied. No new runtime or
development dependency was added; HTTP retrieval, DNS and TLS use Python's standard library.

Official references checked (no snippets copied):
[Vultr chat-completion contract](https://api.vultrinference.com/docs/reference/create-chat-completion)
(response `model` may differ from request; `message.reasoning`; `completion_tokens_details`;
`reasoning.enabled`; `response_format`), [reasoning concept](https://api.vultrinference.com/docs/concepts/reasoning),
[limits](https://api.vultrinference.com/docs/concepts/limits),
[public model list and metadata](https://api.vultrinference.com/v1/models) (unauthenticated
GET, saved as ignored receipts), and the [event page](https://lablab.ai/ai-hackathons/vultr-hackathon)
(redirects to lablab.build). The UI followed the general guidance of the Apache-2.0
"impeccable" design skill (product register) as process guidance; no design tokens, assets
or code were copied from it or from any other project. The actual HTTP retrieval check used
the IANA `https://example.com/` page as a public, weak-evidence target.

## Historical campaign dataset and experiment workspace — 2026-11-05 (fourth continuation)

**Dataset (not bundled, not relicensed).** The MineThatData E-Mail Analytics and Data Mining
Challenge dataset (Kevin Hillstrom, 2008-03-20) is used as the first genuine historical
campaign. Sources: publisher description
<https://blog.minethatdata.com/2008/03/minethatdata-e-mail-analytics-and-data.html>, original
download `http://www.minethatdata.com/Kevin_Hillstrom_MineThatData_E-MailAnalytics_DataMiningChallenge_2008.03.20.csv`,
corroborating catalog <https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/hillstrom> and the independent
checksum file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/datasets/master/tensorflow_datasets/recommendation/hillstrom/checksums.tsv>
(SHA-256 `0e5893329d8b93cefecc571777672028290ab69865718020c78c7284f291aece`, 3,964,977 bytes,
64,000 rows). Citation: Hillstrom, K. (2008). *The MineThatData E-Mail Analytics And Data Mining
Challenge*. MineThatData blog.

Rights boundary: the author explicitly invites analysis and sharing of findings; no explicit
raw-dataset redistribution license was established. Therefore the raw file lives only under
ignored `.local/`, is never committed, bundled into the deployment, served by any route or
mirrored, and is **not** covered by this repository's MIT license. A library's code license or
the TensorFlow documentation license is not a dataset license. Public artifacts are attributed
aggregate analysis (counts, rates, intervals) and the reproducible acquisition and importer code.
The publisher's HTTPS endpoint failed certificate verification during preparation; the plain-HTTP
download URL was used and its bytes matched the independently published checksum. TLS
verification was not disabled anywhere.

**Original code.** The importer, statistics, analysis program, contracts, SQLite store, jobs,
scheduler, packet assembly, API endpoints, React experiment views, tests and checks are
original SalesDesk work. No code was copied from statistics libraries; formulas follow Wilson
(1927) and Newcombe (1998, method 10), with Newcombe's published Table II values used only as
regression test expectations. SQLite is used through Python's standard library; no new runtime
or development dependency was added. The synthetic test fixture in `backend/tests/test_experiments.py`
is invented data in the benchmark's schema and is never shown as evidence.

## Sales workload evidence for submission slides (checked 2026-11-06 UTC)

- [Salesforce State of Sales, seventh edition](https://www.salesforce.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/documents/reports/sales/salesforce-state-of-sales-report-2026.pdf),
  pp. 8 and 21: reported non-selling share and preparation/planning share.
- [Salesforce 2026 report announcement](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/state-of-sales-report-announcement-2026/):
  reported outreach capacity constraint and survey methodology (4,050 professionals,
  22 countries, August–September 2025). Used as linked factual references; no report
  graphics copied. Illustrative team-hour arithmetic is explicitly labelled in the slides.


## Dealer-group sample and industry evidence — 2026-11-06

The generator, fictional Summit Auto Group, fictional people, sample CSVs, regional SVG,
vehicle body icons, matching program and product UI are original SalesDesk contributions
under MIT. Real makes/models are product names; no vehicle photos, manufacturer logos,
real VINs or customer records are imported. Accepted model responses stay in ignored
operator replay storage. No model weights, vendor CRM software or vendor datasets are bundled.
Prettier 3.6.2 (MIT) was used ephemerally for formatting, without a dependency-lock change.

Linked factual evidence, checked 2026-11-06; no report graphics or third-party code copied:

- [DAS Technology 2025 lead response study](https://digitalairstrike.com/das-technology-unveils-comprehensive-automotive-dealership-lead-response-study-at-nada-2025/):
  website inquiry responsiveness and alternatives; vendor-published study with scope/date
  stated in slides. This is not a SalesDesk performance claim.
- [Lithia & Driveway 2025 Form 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1023128/000102312826000015/lad-20251231.htm):
  reported floorplan expense/assistance, contextualized as one group's financial disclosure.
- [Cox Automotive used inventory report, June 13, 2025](https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights/used-vehicle-inventory-may-2025/):
  market days' supply, explicitly distinguished from individual vehicle age.
- [Official challenge](https://lablab.build/ai-hackathons/vultr-hackathon) and
  [LabLab terms](https://lablab.build/terms-of-use) refreshed. No submission or receipt claimed.

The sample's $8/unit/day floorplan figure is an entered assumption, independent of these
sources. No vendor connection, endorsement, integration or affiliation is claimed.

## Video preparation assets

- [Inter, by Rasmus Andersson](https://github.com/rsms/inter), SIL Open Font License 1.1.
  `docs/video/fonts/InterVariable.woff2` and `InterVariable-Italic.woff2` are upstream fonts; `Inter-SemiBold.ttf` is a
  static weight-600 instance for subtitle rendering. The license is included alongside
  both files. Original SalesDesk mark and app styling are reused in original HTML cards.
- Playwright (Apache-2.0), Chromium and FFmpeg render and record the public app and
  assemble the silent edit. FFmpeg with libass renders captions derived from the SRT.
  These tools do not supply stock footage, artificial UI values or customer data.

## Video v5 industry benchmark — checked 2026-11-07

- [Foureyes, 2026 Automotive Dealer Benchmarks Report](https://www.foureyes.io/blog/2026-automotive-dealer-benchmarks-report),
  published 2026-04-22, reporting 2025 dealership website activity. The original
  SalesDesk proof card cites the qualified-lead mishandling rate and conditional
  three-day purchase rate. Dates/scopes and short verbatim evidence excerpts are
  recorded in `docs/video/industry-sources-v5.json`; narration uses no spoken source
  attribution. No report graphics, vendor code or customer records are copied.
  No vendor endorsement, integration, industry-wide loss or SalesDesk recovery
  performance is claimed. See `docs/video/SOURCES-v5.md`.
